# Simple RAG Demo

> Retrieval-Augmented Generation using FAISS, Sentence Transformers, and FLAN-T5.

This is a minimal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system built with:

- FAISS for efficient document retrieval
- `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for embeddings
- `google/flan-t5-base` (or `sshleifer/tiny-t5` for lighter use) for answer generation
- Gradio for the user interface
