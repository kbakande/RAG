OVO Energy: Sustainability, Innovation, and Products
Plan Zero Strategy
Plan Zero is OVO Energy’s roadmap to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2035. It focuses on three pillars: Climate (reducing emissions), Customers (helping households cut carbon), and Culture (embedding sustainability across the business).

Carbon Reduction
Since 2018, OVO has reduced its operational carbon emissions by over 50%. It limits carbon offsetting to no more than 10% of its total emissions.

Renewable Electricity
OVO sources electricity from the UK National Grid, which includes energy from wind, solar, gas, and nuclear. In 2023, OVO shifted from 100% renewable tariffs backed solely by REGOs to power purchase agreements (PPAs) for better traceability.

OVO Solar
In 2023, OVO launched a solar offering for homes. It includes solar panels, batteries, inverters, and a Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) rate, allowing customers to sell excess electricity back to the grid.

Power Move Program
Power Move is an energy usage challenge that rewards customers for shifting their electricity usage away from peak hours (4pm–7pm on weekdays). It helps balance grid demand and reduce carbon intensity.

Heat Pump Plus
OVO offers Heat Pump Plus in partnership with Heat Geek. It provides heat pump installations and a competitive electricity rate of 15p/kWh, making it a viable alternative to gas boilers.

Electric Vehicle Charging
Charge Anytime is OVO’s smart EV charging solution. It enables customers to charge their electric vehicles at home during off-peak hours at reduced rates.

Customer Experience: OVO Beyond
OVO Beyond is a customer-facing mobile app that delivers personalized energy-saving tips, usage analytics, and exclusive offers to OVO members.

CORGI HomePlan
Acquired in 2017, CORGI HomePlan is part of the OVO group and provides boiler servicing and emergency home repairs to over 165,000 customers.
