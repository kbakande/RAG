How It Works: Tailored Training Journey
Step 1: Discovery & Scoping
We begin with a scoping workshop to assess your teamâ€™s current skill levels, their familiarity with Google Cloud, and the tools they use daily. We'll also explore preferences around delivery format (virtual or in-person), geographic locations, and conduct Skills Assessments to benchmark learning progress.

Step 2: Program Customisation
Our learning consultants design a training path that aligns with your business needs. We tailor curriculums to include relevant hands-on exercises, use cases, and industry-specific examples. Programs may blend instructor-led sessions with self-paced learning for maximum flexibility.

Step 3: Delivery & Evaluation
Training is delivered by our world-class instructors either virtually, at your location, or at our Datatonic Academy HQ in Canary Wharf, London. Throughout the program, we evaluate learner progress and conclude with a retrospective session to review outcomes, gather feedback, and plan next steps in your team's learning journey.
